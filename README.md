# Kodilla-project-backend

frontend = https://github.com/draztel/Kodilla-project-frontend

backend port = 8080

To fully use the application you need to have:
1. MySQL database installed
2. Create database named "project" 
3. Create new user with username "admin" with password "admin".
4. Grant all privilages to project
5. Change email configuration in application.properties to your own.
6. Launch both applications frontend and backend on local machine
7. Open site http://localhost:8081


Plans:
-Due to no time, i didn't fully implemented frontend application, so that is first thing i wanna do.
